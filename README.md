# **Montenegro E-commerce | Written in Python & Django**

## A fully functional Django E-commerce

This project, called Montenegro E-commerce, was created as a personal ambition to enhance and practice my expertise with tools like Python, Django, Bootstrap and a little of HTML/CSS.
Here is a list of what is presented in the project:

- Customize default Django authentication - Remove username and use e-mail instead.
- Using django-allauth for allowing users to log in with social accounts, such as Google and Github. (Coming soon)
- Lists to save products that you liked (Coming soon)
- Payment gateway with PayPal (Coming soon)

The base templates, like the home page and details of the product, were not made by me. You can access these following sites to get them:

[Home Page](https://startbootstrap.com/template/shop-homepage) <br>
[Details Page](https://startbootstrap.com/template/shop-item) <br>
[Cart Page](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/extended/shopping-carts/)

If you are a developer and wants to contribute with the project, or even wants to contribute with a constructive criticism, feel free to do it! Your message will be gently recepted by me and I'll appreciate your attention. In case that you wish to modify or implement your piece of code, you can follow the instructions:

1. Fork and clone the project into your machine
2. Create a new virtual environment
   - You'll need to have Python installed, and you should run `python3 -m venv venv`
3. Activate the venv
   - If you're on Linux, in the project folder you would run `source venv/bin/activate`
   - If you're on Windows, in the project folder you would run `source venv/Scripts/activate.bat`
   - In case of something go wrong, you can read the documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
4. Install pip requirements for the project:
   - Run **(remember that this must be done with the venv activated)** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
